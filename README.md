# CedarLogic
This program was created for the CS1220 Term Project
Collaborators: Micah Vranyes and Alben Augustine

## Purpose
It is used to simulate logic gates in conjunction and output the corresponding waveform

## Technologies
It was written in C++ and utilized vectors, maps, and queues

## Bugs
For some logic gates it will output the wrong signal at the end of the waveform
